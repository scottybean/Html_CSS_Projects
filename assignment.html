		<h1>Why I like Rhodesian Ridgebacks</h1>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/rhodesian-ridgeback/">
				<p>The Rhodesian Ridgeback is an all-purpose “Renaissance hound” whose hallmark is the ridge,
			or stripe of backward-growing hair, on his back. Though the breed was made famous in its
			native Africa for its skill at tracking and baying – but never, ever killing – lions, today
			Ridgebacks are cherished family dogs whose owners must be prepared to deal with their 
			independence and strong prey drive.</p>
